<!-- This page must be created from a blank HTML file.
It must include the following as a demonstration of your ability to write HTML and CSS:
An unordered list embedded in an ordered list
At least one image (not from the Bootstrap theme)
An embedded YouTube video (we intentionally didn’t teach you this, so you would have to Google this—good learning experience)
An on-page anchor
A custom background color or image
You also need to link to (and apply) a stylesheet that you have created from scratch. This stylesheet should include:
At least four style definitions (it is possible you will have many more than four styles)
Styles that specify font color
Styles that specify font family
At least three divs that are positioned and styled using your styles
A live and interactive embedded Tableau graph (not just a picture of one).
This graph can be about anything. It doesn’t have to be a graph you created, although it certainly can be.
A quick Google search will show you where to find cool Tableau visualizations.

        <h4>The Element of Line</h4>
        <p>An AI generated article</p>
        <p>In the world of visual art, there are several fundamental elements that artists employ to create captivating and meaningful works. One such element is the humble line. Lines hold a significant place in the realm of art, as they serve as the building blocks for forms, shapes, and compositions. They possess the power to convey emotion, guide the viewer's gaze, and add depth and structure to a piece. Whether bold and dramatic or delicate and subtle, lines play a vital role in the creation and interpretation of artwork.</p>
        <p>First and foremost, lines are the fundamental tools artists use to define shapes and forms. A line can be seen as the contour that outlines an object, giving it its distinct appearance and identity. By manipulating lines, artists can create various shapes and forms, capturing the essence of subjects ranging from human figures to landscapes and still life. For instance, a bold, confident line may be used to depict a strong and powerful figure, while a delicate, flowing line can represent grace and elegance. Thus, lines enable artists to express their artistic vision by providing a visual framework for the subjects they wish to portray.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, lines possess the ability to convey emotions and moods within a piece of art. The direction, length, thickness, and even the quality of a line can evoke different feelings in the viewer. For instance, vertical lines often convey stability, strength, and dignity, while horizontal lines tend to suggest calmness and tranquility. Diagonal lines, on the other hand, can create a sense of movement, energy, and tension. By utilizing these varied line qualities, artists can effectively communicate the intended emotional response to their audience, allowing for a deeper connection between the artwork and the viewer.</p>
        <p>Lines also play a crucial role in guiding the viewer's gaze throughout a composition. The arrangement and flow of lines within a piece can direct the viewer's attention to specific areas or elements within the artwork. Artists strategically employ lines to create pathways, leading the viewer's eye from one point to another, ensuring a deliberate visual experience. By utilizing lines effectively, artists can control the narrative and focus of a piece, emphasizing important elements and creating a sense of balance and harmony.</p>
        <p>Moreover, lines contribute to the overall sense of depth and dimension within a work of art. Through the use of contour lines, hatching, or cross-hatching techniques, artists can create the illusion of three-dimensional space on a two-dimensional surface. By manipulating lines to create highlights, shadows, and textures, artists can evoke a sense of depth, making the artwork more visually engaging and realistic. Lines can also be employed to suggest perspective, with converging lines leading the viewer's gaze into the distance, enhancing the sense of space within the composition.</p>
        <p>In summary, lines are an indispensable element of art, serving as the foundation for forms, shapes, and compositions. They possess the power to evoke emotions, guide the viewer's gaze, and create depth and dimension within a piece. Whether through bold strokes or delicate curves, artists harness the versatility of lines to express their artistic vision, communicate ideas, and engage the viewer on multiple levels. So, the next time you admire a painting, drawing, or sculpture, take a moment to appreciate the importance and impact of lines in bringing the artwork to life.</p>
